                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>I am currently majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Spanish at Berea College.
				I am hoping to attend graduate school and obtain my doctorate in Computer Science.
				I have previous experience as a teaching assistant and have done undergraduate research.
				I am interested in the fields of cybersecurity, machine learning, and data science.
				I love learning new things and very passionate about technology. I am continually learning
				new skills to solve real world problems. I want to use technology to help people and serve my community.
				<br>
				<br>
				My other interests include participating in sports. I enjoy playing basketball, softball, and swimming.
				I like hiking, making crafts, coaching, and working with children. I find myself being actively involved
				in my community and serving others through community service projects. I love to work on various technological
				projects, and collaborate with others to gain new techniques for the building of different applications. </p>

                <p>CSC 426 is a computer science class at Berea College.
		The complete title is CSC 426: Open Source Software
		Engineering. Here is the catalog description: </p>

		<p>An introduction to open source software engineering,
		the course covers the philosophy and practice of
		developing software in large, distributed teams. Students
		will explore social and technological aspects of this
		process by contributing directly to an existing open
		course project. In doing so, students will learn the
		tools, the techniques, and the strategies -- technical
		and social -- that are common to all developers working
		in teams through this semester-long exercise.</p>
